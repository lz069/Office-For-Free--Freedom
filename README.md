# Office-For-Free(Freedom)-(OFF)-
Open-source office software

OFF is one open-source project for free office software, named Office For Free (Freedom). pdf js is used as temperoray viewer in this project due to limit of development time.

At present, development is focused on the PDF format. Functions like split, merge, and so on have been merged into this software. More functions user-friendly will be developed in the future.

As to formats like docx and excel, these will be merged into this software in further versions.

Different from other office softwares, this software aims to make office work more automated and simplified without too much operation. (especially for users who can't afford those expensive licenses)

This project is just getting started. Thus, many libraries and functions will be subtituted. If anybody is interested or has any problem, please feel free to reach out to me and join in.
